# Kiddies Spot 
<hr>
This website is created for a business idea about a children amusement/learning place, similar to a children's museum. The website is geared towards children and their parents, where they can easily find information about the approach the business offers in children's fun and learning experience. The business is actually my sister's idea. She wants to create a place where children can explore as many activities as possible in order for them to discover at an early stage in their life what they like and what they don't, what they feel curious about and what they feel more inclined to enjoy.

The website's goal is to find all relevant information about the place easily with very little user's effort, while also being easy to interact with. The website should illustrate the concept of the business quickly and at first glance with the goal of capturing the user's interest, which will ultimately lead him/her to visit the place and/or purchase the tickets in advance.

## UX
<hr>

### User Story
The website is consists of a few pages. Each page focuses on the pertaining topic/section and each page contains concise content, in order to keep the page short, as to reduce scrolling. The header (which contains the links to the pages), is convenienty fixed and available to the user as he/she scrolls down or up.
The font that is larger than other typical websites. This is done to convey a child-friendly subliminal message. Many pictures are included to illustrate the message of "Fun/playful learning" at first glance. The typical user (parents) will most likely be pressed of time to do a lot of reading so pictures are useful here.


**User Type (Scope)**
- Parents or child care-taker, with chidren ranging from 5 years old to 12
- Live anywhere in the world but geared more towards residents of the Onslow County and sorroundings, in the state of North Carolina
- All levels of disposible income
- English speaking
- Children as passive viewers (they might be seeing the website while sitting beside the adult user)

**As a user:**
- I expect to learn about what this place has to offer to my children for entertainment and learning. 
- I expect so see information (preferably with images) on what the place looks like inside and at the very least a glimpse of the activities they offer.
- I want to be able to easily navigate the website to find relevant information such as: 
  1. Activities being offered to the children at the site
  2. Pictures of what the place looks like inside
  3. Suitable age
  4. Address and Telephone 
  5. Contact info and form to fillout and send
  6. Hours of operations
  7. Events and signup form
  8. Ticket price information 

### Strategy
This website's intent is to easily and concisely communicate to users why they should choose this place for their children's entertainment and educational experience, as well as to engage them into to purchasing tickets upon learning about the business. The typical user will be a parent or a child care-taker; these type of users don't have a lot of time to read large content and will most likely look for images that can help them make a decision. Because this is a business geared toward children, the website must convey a welcoming, friendly message with a fun theme. The website will grow in content but such will be organized in a way it does not overwhelm the user with too much content and endless scrolling, but instead will engage them enough to make the expected decision probable: visit us, call us, or purchase tickets in advance,and eventually become a member. 

### Structure used to help them users achieve these things:
- The website is mostly linear, with easy-to-read fonts and images that best illustrate the service being offered. 
- The images will help the user identify their children with the children depicted, as well as fulfill its informational purpose. 
- The website contains a separate page for each section, as opposed to a single long page. This will help the user's take in each page's information easily without much need to scroll. It will gice the user a break between page and page. Pages are purposely short, to reduce the need of too much srolling in order to find information needed. 
- The header navigation bar is clipped to the top and remains that way as the user scrolls down or up, thus providing convenient way to access the pages. 
- Footer provides quick links, which act as a shortcut to, for example, planning their visit and events. Footer also includes social media icons


### Design
The website is fully responsive. To achieve this, I used [Bootstrap 4.3.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/download/)

### Font
The font-family is 'Salsa' with cursive style. This font type is used for the top header (menu), headlines and buttons. This font was imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Salsa?query=salsa). The font style is shaped with soft curves as a friendly, easy-to-read font. The default font is Helvetica

### Logo
It uses the same different colors as throughout the website, with white background for a cleaner look. The image was purchased from [iStockphoto](https://www.istockphoto.com/), but I am planning on designing my own logo later on 


### Color Scheme
All colors were chosen using the [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel). Different bright colors were used throughout the home page to give a colorful/playful look, as using different colors is typical in places geared toward children. 
However, for the other pages, each page focused on a predominant color. I did not want to have a single predominant theme color throughout the entire website. So, I came up with the idea of using a predominant color on each page; said color would match the color of the page link on the header menu. This will give uniqueness to the each page while also making it fun to navigate from page to page. For example, the About Us page menu link is purple; and the About Us webpage's predominant color is purple.

Nav color:
- ![#87EB31](https://placehold.it/15/87EB31/000000?text=+) `#87EB31`. Used gradient toward white for a smoother look

Footer color:
- ![#1A8849](https://placehold.it/15/1A8849/000000?text=+) `#1A8849`

Other colors:
 - About us page: ![#AB6BFF](https://placehold.it/15/AB6BFF/000000?text=+) `#AB6BFF`
 - Rooms page: ![#4FB156](https://placehold.it/15/4FB156/000000?text=+) `#4FB156`
 - Plan Your Visit page: ![#FF9F30](https://placehold.it/15/FF9F30/000000?text=+) `#FF9F30`
 - Events page: ![#FF9F30](https://placehold.it/15/FF9F30/000000?text=+) `#FF9F30`
 - Contact Us page: ![#00BCE4](https://placehold.it/15/00BCE4/000000?text=+) `#00BCE4`

Font color: ![#fafafa](https://placehold.it/15/fafafa/000000?text=+) `#fafafa`

Modal and mask color: ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000`

## Features
<hr>

Each page features a responsive navigation bar with conventional placing of logo (top left). Each page has a footer with copyright information, social media icons (currently, there is no real link social media pages for there is no existing social media accounts) and quick links to other pages within the website.
Every page displays a picture banner, except for the home page, which displays a slidehow of images as the banner.

#### Home page
inform the user about what the business offers. The user will see the main concept in a short phrases: "Discover a world of Fun" and "Learn by Play". Also,a happy picture of children having fun is included to help convey the playing/fun atmosphere. The page will also display a clean gallery of pictures of some the activities kids can do. Each activity is performed in a "Room". Clicking on any of these gallery images will take the user to the "Rooms" page. 
Lastly, the website encourages the user to plan their visit by supplying a "Plan Your Visit" button, which upon clicking, will direct the user to the "Plan Your Visit" page. 

#### About us 
brief information of the business origins and how they came up with the idea. It also includes an easy-to-read and follow timelime so the user can see progress and milestones. Lastly,the site includes a few reviews from previous parents to reassure the user this is the right place for their children. Lastly,the website encourages the user to plan their visit by supplying a "Plan Your Visit" button, which upon clicking, will direct the user to the "Plan Your Visit" page.

### Rooms
This page consists of a grid layout of images, each portraying a room/activity. For desktop, each row contains 3 images, for tablet each row contains 2 columns and for mobile devices, a single image takes up the width of the screen. 
Each image is bordered with semi-rounded corners and displays the title/caption beneth it. When user hovers over each image with the mouse, a black overlay with transparency displays as well as a brief description of the room in question in white font. If the user clicks on the image, then the image scales up to a larger size (taking up about 70% of the screen) in a centered position, which allows the user to appreciate the image in better detail. The scaled image has a larger black background/mask with some transparency and an "x" on the upper right-hand side which, if clicked, will close the image and return the user to the gallery page, to the same position it was left off before clicking the image; this functionality was accomplished by using javascript (see js/script.js). 

#### Plan Your Visit
this page features easy-to-read straight-forward information on the hours of operation, address and ticket prices. It also has a helpful button  (currently,not functional) to purhase the tickets online and another button (now fully functional) called "Get Directions" which, if clicked, will open a Google Map page on a separate tab. Lastly, the page includes a button (currently, not functional) to start a membership.

### Events
this page features all the information on the current events for the current month. Each event has a paragraph with pertaining information as well as a descriptive image. At first glance, the page shows the first event being fully displayed, while the other ones that follow only display the tittle, which the user can click on to see more the information, quickly unfolded below the title. To accomplish this retracting/unfolding functionality, a jQuery Accordion was implemented. The accordion approach is done with the purpose of not displaying too much information at once, and leaving up to the user to click on the event of interest to learn more about is. Lastly, a sticky Signup button appears on the right-hand side, which if clicked on, will display a form and a submit button. The functionality of the form appearing on the click of the button is accomplished with the use of jQuery and Javascript. The form is fully funtional in that a real email will be received on a real email account. In order to make this email process possible, Email JS API was used. 

#### Contact us
helpful website with easy to fill-out form (now fully functional with Email JS API) for questions and concerns. It also provides information such as telephone number and our email address for alternative ways to contact us. A Google map (implemented with GoogleMap API) is added to give the user a better idea of our location. Lastly, the page includes a "Get Directions" button (fully functional)which, if clicked, will open a Google Map page on a separate tab.

User Experience testing: 

The user will mainly come to this website to obtain information on what we have to offer, find out about our events, purchase tickets and obtain crucial information such as our address and telephone number. The user would also want to reach us via email with questions, comments or requests. 

As a user I want to be able to find the information I want easily. I want to be able to navigate the site and not go through a lot of "clicks" to get the information I am looking for.
 - The website satisfies this need by:
    1. Supplying a navigation bar containing descriptive titles links to the different pages. The nav bar is anchored to the top area of the screen and is available as the user scrolls down, saving the user's need to scroll back to the top of the page in order to use it. 
    2. The logo, located on the top left-hand side allows a direct access to the home page
    3. Quick links on the footer offer other helpful links to some of the pages

As a user, I would like to obtain information about what the place looks like and the activities they offer
 
- The website satisfies this need by showing descriptive images of the different "Rooms" in two separate pages: one small gallery on the Home page and a full gallery on the Rooms page. The images on the Home page are clickable and linked to the Rooms page. As a user I know I can find out more about the room/activity image as soon as hover over it, as I see the "See More" message along with a magnifying glass icon. The "Rooms" page shows all the images of the available rooms, the user will intuitively hover over each image and quickly see more information and if clicked on the image, the user will see the image enlarged for better view  

As a potential customer, I want to find basic yet crucial information I need prior to visiting the place. Crucial information includes: location, telephone, hours of operation and ticket price.
  - The website satisifies this need by supplying this location and telphone number  on the footer, making it accessible regardlesss on the page the user is on. Also, most of the same information is located in the "Plan Your Visit" page. 
  - Also, the "Plan Your Visit" button is located on the bottom section of the About Us and Home page. This gives the user the convenience to get to the visitor information needed right after learning about the business. The button acts as a subtle "reminder" to go ahead and visit the place, saving the user from having to look up the page's link on the navigation's bar. 

  As a curious user, I would like to know more about the organization, how they started and what has been the experience of other parents, so that I can be reassusred this is the right place to take my children to. 
   - The website satisfies this need by supplying the About us page, which shows how the idea of how the business came about, which customer's need(s) is fulfilling, the milestone accomplished and the reviews of other parents.

 As a potential customer, I would like to obtain information on how to get to the place.
  - The website satisfies this need by supplying an illustrative Google Map, which serves as the best visual tool in order to give the user an idea of our location. This map is located where the user would expect it to find: the Contact Us page. Also, an intuitively Get Directions button facilitates the user's need to get to the location. This button is also present in the Plan Your Visit page, so that user does not have navigate away from this page in order to find, reach and use this feature
     - Testing the Get Directions button
   1. Hover over the button. Button and font color should change upon hovering.
   2. Click the button. As a result, user is taken to separate tab showing Google Maps page with the address of the business as the destination

As a user, I would like to see what events the place offers. This is quite important to first-time users as well as returning users. 
 - The website satisfies this need by offering the Events page, in which all events are nicely displayed by date. By default, the first event of the month is fully shown. The rest of the events I can learn more from once I click the event title. This is a quick, easy and clean approach, as I will not be overloaded with some much information at once. 

 As a user, I would like to be able to reach out to the business for any questions, comments or requests I may have. I would like to be able to have the choice to communicate by phone, email or via a contact form.
  - the website satisfies this need by supplying the different ways to reach the business suah as the easy to access Contact us page, which includes a contact form to fill-out, telephone number and an email address.

### Existing issue
The border on the accordion on Events page sometimes displays a quirky edge on the left-hand side. I cannot reproduce the issue all the time and sometimes it goes away on its own and it might not even appear during the review of the project CI. I need to continue digging into this cosmetic problem
