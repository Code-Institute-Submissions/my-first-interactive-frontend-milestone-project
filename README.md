# Kiddies Spot 

This website is created for a business idea about a children amusement/learning place, similar to a children's museum. The website is geared toward the children and their parents, where in information about the approach the business offers in children's fun and unique experience of learning. The business is actually my sister's idea. She wants to create a place where children can explore as many activities as possible in order for them to discover at a nearly stage in theri lives what they like and what they don't, what they feel curious about and what they feel more inclined to enjoy. the website will also engage the parents into buting the tickets, attent the events andbecome a memeber.

## UX
### User Story 
As a user, I expect to learn about what this place has to offer to my children for entertainment and learning experience. I expect so see information (preferably with images) on what the place looks like inside and at least a glimpse of the activities they offer. I want to be to easily find the address, ways to conact them, their hours and the price of the tickets. 

### Strategy
This website's intent is to easily and concisely communicate why they should choose this place for their children's entertainment and educational experience, as well as to engage them into to purchasing tickets upon learning about us.The typical user will be a parent or a child care-taker; these type of users don't have a lot of time to read large content and will most likely look for mages that can help them make a decision. Becuase this is a business geared toward children, the website must convey a welcoming, friendly message within a fun theme. The website will grow in content but such will be orginized in a way it does not overwhelm the user, but instead will engage them enought to continue learning more about us.

We want the user to make a decision to go for it: buy the tickets in advance (prior to their visit) right from our website, and eventually become a member. 

### Scope
For adult users who are parents or child care-taker. Users with children in mind, who at the same time are or can be "passive" viewers as well. Supply information and visual content on the education and fun activities, games, events, and new experiences we offer to children. 


### Structure
The website is mostly linear, with easy to read fonts and images to best desribe the service. The images will help the user identify themselves with them as well as fill an informational purpose. 
Pages are not very long, as the user might not engage in lots of scrolling to find the information neded. The header navigation bar is clipped to the top and remains that way as the user scrolls down, thus providing convenient way to access information.

### Surface
I wanted the website to be colorful enough to convey a playful fun message, while using a neutral color - in this case white - for the background on order to achieve a clean style. I did not want to have a predominant theme color through the entire website. So, I came up with the idea of using a predominant color on each page; said color would match the color of the page link on the header menu. This will give uniquess to the each page while also making it fun to navigate from page to page. Of course, there is a consistency in font, style and structure; the only change is the theme color. For exmaple, the About Us page menu link is purple; and the About Us webpage's predominant color is purple.
